GeneMANIA helps you predict the function of your favourite genes and gene sets on your own machine. 

The interface is backed by powerful analysis software and a large data warehouse containing extensive amounts of existing functional genomics data. The GeneMANIA virtual machine provides a local copy of the GeneMANIA webserver. Everything is self contained, and no internet access is required to use it.

    copied the image, pick &#8220;Moved&#8221;.
  2. To log in, the user is genemania and the password is genemania.

    local GeneMANIA instance.
  4. A text file on the desktop contains more information about starting/
  
    stopping/managing the GeneMANIA components.</p> 

## Using the Virtual Machine

While the GeneMANIA virtual machine is self contained and does not require internet access, the recommended way of using it is to run it on a dedicated machine on a local area network. This allows anyone to access the GeneMANIA virtual machine over the network using their preferred operating system and browser.
