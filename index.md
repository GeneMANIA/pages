## GeneMANIA helps you predict the function of your favourite genes and gene sets.

GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. You can use GeneMANIA to find new members of a pathway or complex, find additional genes you may have missed in your screen or find new genes with a specific function, such as protein kinases. Your question is defined by the set of genes you input.

If members of your gene list make up a protein complex, GeneMANIA will return more potential members of the protein complex. If you enter a gene list, GeneMANIA will return connections between your genes, within the selected datasets. [Learn more&#8230;](/help)

GeneMANIA is also accessible via a [Cytoscape app](/cytoscape-app), designed for power users.

GeneMANIA is actively developed at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/), in the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](http://www.thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/), in the labs of [Gary Bader](http://www.baderlab.org/) and [Quaid Morris](http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/).  GeneMANIA development was originally funded by [Genome Canada](http://www.genomecanada.ca/), through the [Ontario Genomics Institute](http://www.ontariogenomics.ca/) (2007-OGI-TD-05) and is now funded by the [Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation](http://www.mri.gov.on.ca/english/programs/orf/gl2/program.asp). GeneMANIA is also supported by the [National Resource for Network Biology](http://nrnb.org) (P41 GM103504).
